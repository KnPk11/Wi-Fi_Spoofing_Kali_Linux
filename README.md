Concept
===============================
This script was used to counter my much younger brother who at one point used to spend a bit too much time playing video games on our family computer that was located in my room. One day I decided to prank him. I installed Kali Linux on a virtual machine and programmed two scripts: #1 limited his wi-fi download/upload speed at random intervals. #2 cut his minecraft/skype traffic for a second or two at random time intervals to make the gaming experience laggy and unenjoyable
