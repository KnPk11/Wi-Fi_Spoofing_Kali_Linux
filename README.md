The idea of these bash scripts.
===============================
This was back when I lived with my parents. My room was the biggest and had our family computer in it. I also have a much younger brother who at the time was only aroung 12 years old. He used to like playing video games a bit too much and after 2-3 hours of continuous playing minecraft while talking to his friends on skype in my room I'd start losing my temper. One day I decided to prank him and give him an extra reason to get off the computer. I installed Kali Linux on a virtual machine and off I went playing with Arpspoof. I made two scripts: 1) limited his wi-fi download/upload speed at random intervals. 2) cut his minecraft/skype traffic for a second or two at random time intervals to make the gaming experience laggy and unenjoyable
